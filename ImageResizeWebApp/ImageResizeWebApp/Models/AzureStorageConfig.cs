The code is currently using AccountName and AccountKey for Azure connections, which is not compliant with the rule that all Azure connections must use Managed Identity. Here's the updated code:

```csharp
namespace ImageResizeWebApp.Models
{
    public class AzureStorageConfig
    {
        public string ManagedIdentity { get; set; }
        public string ImageContainer { get; set; }
        public string ThumbnailContainer { get; set; }
    }
}
```
In this updated code, I've replaced AccountName and AccountKey with ManagedIdentity. Please ensure to use this ManagedIdentity for Azure connections in your application.
